# Signup form

The form is made with Angular's reactive technique - Reactive Forms. For animation purposes the GSAP library is included to complement events, like selecting a favorite Ninja Turtle. 

The end result of the form is outputed to the console after the completition.

This can easily be a starting point for creating real forms with Angular.
